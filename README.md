# asc-data-preprocessing

In this assignments, we will learn the basic of data preprocessing for machine learning applications. Specifically, we will learn:

- Loading data with explicit Data typing
- Dealing with missing data
- Handing categorical data
- Feature selection
- Feature importance


# Task

1. Do `exercise/excercise_0*.py` by following the instruction in the comment out. They are not grading items. So feel free to change as you wish.

2. Implement the functions in `assignments/assignment.py`. This is the grading item.

3. Generate a swarm plot illustrating the importance of features in the Titanic dataset using the `shap` library. Complete the task in `exercise_03.py` to create this figure. Submit the figure and a plain text file (maximum 300 words) interpreting the results on Brightspace.

4. Git commit & Push Your edit.


### Instruction

1. You can verify your implementation by using the exercise_0*.py scripts. If you prefer to work with Jupyter notebook, you can convert the Python script by jupytext. `jupytext --to notebook <name_of_script_file>.py`

2. [You can review your autograding results](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/learn-with-github-classroom/view-autograding-results)

3. If you have any questions, use a special "Feedback" pull request to specify the part in question in the code. And text the instructors with the link. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/leave-feedback-with-pull-requests) for this Feedback pull request.
