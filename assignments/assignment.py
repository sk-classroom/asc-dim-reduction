        Hint:
        -----
        To implement LDA with numpy, follow these steps:
        1. Compute the mean vectors for each class.
        2. Compute the within-class scatter matrix.
        3. Compute the between-class scatter matrix.
        4. Compute the eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues for the scatter matrices.
        5. Sort the eigenvectors by decreasing eigenvalues and choose k eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues to form a d×k dimensional matrix W.
        6. Use this d×k eigenvector matrix to transform the samples onto the new subspace.
